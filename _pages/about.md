Kanchan Chowdhury is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.marquette.edu/computer-science/) in the [Klingler College of Arts and Sciences](https://www.marquette.edu/arts-sciences/) at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/). His research interests lie in the areas of machine learning systems, geospatial data management, and database systems. Before joining Marquette University, Kanchan was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Arizona State University where he was wisely mentored by [Professor Dr. Jia Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/jiazou-web/home). His postdoctoral research focused on integrating the optimization power of database engines into machine learning systems to enable in-database machine learning. Kanchan completed his PhD in Computer Science from the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University in the summer of 2024. His PhD research was supervised by [Professor Dr. Mo Sarwat](https://mosarwat.org/) and [Professor Dr. Jia Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/jiazou-web/home). During PhD, he worked on building novel systems for efficient processing and utilization of large scale geospatial and spatio-temporal data with applications to machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Kanchan worked as a Research & Development Intern at [Wherobots Inc](https://wherobots.com/) during Spring 2023 and Summer 2023. Besides, he obtained Master of Science in Computer Science from Arizona State University in 2022. Before joining Arizona State University, he obtained Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in 2014. He also worked as a Software Engineer with several IT companies during the period of 2015 to 2018.

<p style="color: red;">⭐ Kanchan is looking for graduate students to join his lab, DAISS (Database, AI, and Spatial Systems) Lab, starting from Fall 2026. If you are interested and your interest alligns with his research, please email your CV, transcripts, and other relevant materials to kanchan.chowdhury@marquette.edu.⭐</p>
