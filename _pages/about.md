I am a PhD student in Computer Science in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. I am a member of [Data Systems Lab](https://www.datasyslab.net/) where I am supervised by [Professor Dr. Sarwat](http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/sarwat/). My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning, big data analytics, database systems, and geospatial data management. My current research focuses on applying machine learning and distributed systems to improve the efficiency of Trajectory data queries.

Before joining Arizona State University, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in 2014. I also worked as a Software Engineer with several IT companies during the period of 2015 to 2018.
