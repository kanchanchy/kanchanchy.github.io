I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My PhD research is supervised by [Professor Dr. Mo Sarwat](https://mosarwat.org/) and [Professor Dr. Jia Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/jiazou-web/home). My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning, big data analytics, geospatial data management, and database systems. My current research focuses on building noble systems for efficient processing and utilization of large scale geospatial and spatio-temporal data with applications to machine learning and deep learning techniques.

I worked as a Research & Development Intern at [Wherobots Inc](https://wherobots.com/) during Spring 2023 and Fall 2023. Before joining Arizona State University, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in 2014. I also worked as a Software Engineer with several IT companies during the period of 2015 to 2018.
