Optimizing Hyperparameters of CNN
======
Performance of a multi-layer neural network always depends on hyper-parameters such as learning rate, mini batch size, dropout rate, starting learning rate, and learning rate etc. Optimizing hyper-parameters of a multi-layer neural network is always a challenging task. This project implements two ways of optimizing hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network and compares their performances: 1) Grid Search and 2) Bayesian Optimization. It optimizes three particular hyper-parameters: learning rate, dropout for first fully connected layer and dropout for second fully connected layer.
