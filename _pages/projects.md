Problem Solving
======
I loved to solve problems on UVa Online Judge and Light OJ when I was an undergraduate student. During my graduate study, I solved problems in LeetCode. I solved 240+ problems on LeetCode, 305 problems in UVa Online Judge, 46 problems in Light OJ and participated in many programming contests both in real-time and online.

Projects
======

GeoTorchAI Deep Learning Framework
------
GeoTorchAI, formerly known as GeoTorch, is a spatiotemporal deep learning framework on top of PyTorch and Apache Sedona. It enable spatiotemporal machine learning practitioners to easily and efficiently implement deep learning models targeting the applications of raster imagery datasets and spatiotemporal non-imagery datasets. Besides deep learning, it also supports scalable and distributed data preprocessing for raster and spatiotemporal datasets.

ML Aware Spatial Data Repartitioning
------
This is a framework which aims at reducing the training time and memory usage of a spatial machine learning model by reducing the number of partitions in a spatial grid dataset. Experiments on four datasets achieved significant reduction in training time and memory consumption while bounding the difference in prediction error within 5%.

ExBoost: Model Decomposition Framework
------
An out-of-box AI/ML-SQL co-optimization approach for end-to-end inference workflows where the users specify a SQL query and a pre-trained model exported in ONNX format, and the end-to-end processing will be automatically optimized reducing the execution latency.

Spatio-Temporal Data Processing on Apache Spark/Apache Sedona
------
This work performs spatial and temporal data processing steps using Apache Sedona on the raw dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The final goal is to convert the dataset into two tensors: i) spatio-temporal tensor and ii) spatial grid tensor.

Data Visualization in Python
------
It performs statistical data analysis using useful visualizations with three Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. Visualizations include but are not limited to line plot, scatter plot, pie chart, histograms, bnar plots, subplot, 3D plot, pair plot, count plot, dist plot, heatmaps, correlation plot, gantt chart, bubble chart, sunburst, box plot, density plot, and violin plot.

GGfone: Free Voice Calls Over Wifi + Wifi Calling
------
GGfone is an Android platform based mobile application featuring high-quality international calls at super affordable costs, unlimited free voice calls with HD quality between this application users, transfering credit balance to other users, and earning free credit by doing simple tasks. This application was developed during my work at Gagagugu PTE LTD.

GagaGugu Android Application
------
GagaGugu is an Android platform based mobile application which supports social networking and communications. Supported functionalities include but are not limited to messaging, free audio and video calls, updating posts, sharing videos, news, and other posts. This application was developed during my work at Gagagugu PTE LTD.

ChefOnline - Order Takeaway App
------
ChefOnline - Order Takeaway App is an Android based mobile application for restaurants developed supporting the features such as online orders and reservations. This application was developed during my work at Le Chef Plc.
