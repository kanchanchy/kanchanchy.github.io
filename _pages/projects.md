Most of my recent projects are related to machine learning and distributed database systems. Besides, I also developed some Android aplications before starting my PhD. Few of my projects are listed here. My other projects can be found on my [Github Repository](https://github.com/kanchanchy).

I loved to solve problems on UVa Online Judge and Light OJ when I was an undergraduate student. All of solved problems on UVa Online Judge can be found [here](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=20&page=show_authorstats&userid=77454). 

Optimizing Hyperparameters of CNN
======
Performance of a multi-layer neural network always depends on hyper-parameters such as learning rate, mini batch size, dropout rate, starting learning rate, and learning rate etc. Optimizing hyper-parameters of a multi-layer neural network is always a challenging task. This project implements two ways of optimizing hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network and compares their performances: 1) Grid Search and 2) Bayesian Optimization. It optimizes three particular hyper-parameters: learning rate, dropout for first fully connected layer and dropout for second fully connected layer.
